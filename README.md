This get repository contains the work (labs and projects) that I completed for comp 20, Web Design.

My favorite assignment was the security project, due to it's open-ended nature. I really enjoyed being given the task of findin gsecurity vulnerabilities and having to experiment and explore to figure out how to complete the problem.

I've definitely learned a lot over the course of the class with regards to the interaction between the client and the server and how the server side works in particular. I feel like I'm in a really good position to start exploring and experimenting on my own with the tools I've learned over this semester.

The most important thing I've learned in this course is how http requests work. This helps me both with creating responsive websites that can make requests to servers and APIs for data, and to allow the servers to communicate with the client and other servers.

I would like to delve deeper into how other programs could be tied into a web server-- for example, how might I run a C or LUA file from a server if I wanted to do more powerful processing.
