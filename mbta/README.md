I completed the project completely, as far as I am aware, though I would have liked to sort the incoming trains by distance and update the schedule continously. 

Most of what I needed (ergo the specifics of JSON manipulation and making HTTP requests) I learned over the course of working on my Polyhack project with Quinn Collins and Nikolas Shashok.

I spent maybe four or five hours on the project.
